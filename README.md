# Travel_flask_app
This is my first app on the Flask learning course.
I make travel site, that offers some nice tours from several towns. Small site for 3 or more pages.

Using dependencies: Flask, bootstrap 4. No database.

It should have:
### *in progress*
* main page (main adv bar and 3 random tours);
* page with all tours (all tours, perhaps, with pagination); #TODO
* page with tours from a certain town;
* page of a certain tour (with buy-tour button, i don't know yet how to make payment stuff);
* admin's page with logging in for creating/editing/deleting tours; #TODO

You could run this app through [Heroku](<https://www.heroku.com>), just upload this repository there. (gunicorn and Procfile are already inclusive)
