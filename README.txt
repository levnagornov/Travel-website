It's my first Flask app.
I make travel site, that offers some nice tours from several towns.

It should have:
main page (main adv bar and 3 random tours)
page with all tours (all tours, perhaps, with pagination)
page with tours from a certain town
page of a certain tour (with buy-tour button, i don't know yet how to make payment stuff)
admin's page with logging in for creating/editing/deleting tours
